    abstract = {Community detection methods help reveal the meso-scale structure
                of complex networks. Integral to detecting communities is the
                expectation that communities in a network are edge-dense and
                “well-connected”. Surprisingly, we find that five different
                community detection methods–the Leiden algorithm optimizing the
                Constant Potts Model, the Leiden algorithm optimizing modularity,
                Infomap, Markov Cluster (MCL), and Iterative k-core
                (IKC)–identify communities that fail even a mild requirement for
                well-connectedness. To address this issue, we have developed the
                Connectivity Modifier (CM), which iteratively removes small edge
                cuts and re-clusters until communities are well-connected
                according to a user-specified criterion. We tested CM on
                real-world networks ranging in size from approximately 35,000 to
                75,000,000 nodes. Post-processing of the output of community
                detection methods by CM resulted in a reduction in node coverage.
                Results on synthetic networks show that the CM algorithm
                generally maintains or improves accuracy in recovering true
                communities. This study underscores the importance of network
                clusterability–the fraction of a network that exhibits community
                structure–and the need for more models of community structure
                where networks contain nodes that are not assigned to
                communities. In summary, we address well-connectedness as an
                important aspect of clustering and present a scalable open-source
                tool for well-connected clusters.},
