    abstract = {Community detection methods help reveal the meso-scale structure
                of complex networks. Integral to detecting communities is the
                expectation that communities in a network are edge-dense and
                “well-connected”. Surprisingly, we find that five different
                community detection methods–the Leiden algorithm optimizing the
                Constant Potts Model, the Leiden algorithm optimizing modularity,
                Infomap, Markov Cluster (MCL), and Iterative k-core
                (IKC)–identify communities that fail even a mild requirement for
                well-connectedness. To address this issue, we have developed the
                Connectivity Modifier (CM), which iteratively removes small edge
                cuts and re-clusters until communities are well-connected
                according to a user-specified criterion. We tested CM on
                real-world networks ranging in size from approximately 35,000 to
                75,000,000 nodes. Post-processing of the output of community
                detection methods by CM resulted in a reduction in node coverage.
                Results on synthetic networks show that the CM algorithm
                generally maintains or improves accuracy in recovering true
                communities. This study underscores the importance of network
                clusterability–the fraction of a network that exhibits community
                structure–and the need for more models of community structure
                where networks contain nodes that are not assigned to
                communities. In summary, we address well-connectedness as an
                important aspect of clustering and present a scalable open-source
                tool for well-connected clusters.},

    abstract = "The stochastic block model (SBM) is a mixture model for the
                clustering of nodes in networks. The SBM has now been employed
                for more than a decade to analyze very different types of
                networks in many scientific fields, including biology and the
                social sciences. Recently, an analytical expression based on the
                collapsing of the SBM parameters has been proposed, in
                combination with a sampling procedure that allows the clustering
                of the vertices and the estimation of the number of clusters to
                be performed simultaneously. Although the corresponding algorithm
                can technically accommodate up to 10 000 nodes and millions of
                edges, the Markov chain, however, tends to exhibit poor mixing
                properties, that is, low acceptance rates, for large networks.
                Therefore, the number of clusters tends to be highly
                overestimated, even for a very large number of samples. In this
                article, we rely on a similar expression, which we call the
                integrated complete data log likelihood, and propose a greedy
                inference algorithm that focuses on maximizing this exact
                quantity. This algorithm incurs a smaller computational cost than
                existing inference techniques for the SBM and can be employed to
                analyze large networks (several tens of thousands of nodes and
                millions of edges) with no convergence problems. Using toy
                datasets, the algorithm exhibits improvements over existing
                strategies, both in terms of clustering and model selection. An
                application to a network of blogs related to illustrations and
                comics is also provided.",

             models",
    author = "Yen, Tzu-Chi and Larremore, Daniel B",
    abstract = "In bipartite networks, community structures are restricted to
                being disassortative, in that nodes of one type are grouped
                according to common patterns of connection with nodes of the
                other type. This makes the stochastic block model (SBM), a highly
                flexible generative model for networks with block structure, an
                intuitive choice for bipartite community detection. However,
                typical formulations of the SBM do not make use of the special
                structure of bipartite networks. Here we introduce a Bayesian
                nonparametric formulation of the SBM and a corresponding
                algorithm to efficiently find communities in bipartite networks
                which parsimoniously chooses the number of communities. The biSBM
                improves community detection results over general SBMs when data
                are noisy, improves the model resolution limit by a factor of
                sqrt[2], and expands our understanding of the complicated
                optimization landscape associated with community detection tasks.
                A direct comparison of certain terms of the prior distributions
                in the biSBM and a related high-resolution hierarchical SBM also
                reveals a counterintuitive regime of community detection problems
                , populated by smaller and sparser networks, where

                and one promising approach is the Stochastic Block Model (SBM).
                But the influences from various fields led to a diversity of
                variants and inference methods. Therefore, a comparison of the
                existing techniques and an independent analysis of their
                capabilities and weaknesses is needed. As a first step, we review
                the development of different SBM variants such as the
                degree-corrected SBM of Karrer and Newman or Peixoto's
                hierarchical SBM. Beside stating all these variants in a uniform
                notation, we show the reasons for their development. Knowing the
                variants, we discuss a variety of approaches to infer the optimal
                partition like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We perform our
                analysis based on our extension of the Girvan-Newman test and the
                Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark as well as a selection

                guidance to the challenging task of selecting an inference method

                determine the number of steps for the Metropolis-Hastings
                algorithms that lack a usual stop criterion. With our comparison,
                we hope to guide researches in the field of SBM and highlight the
                problem of existing techniques to focus future research. Finally,

                for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain
                algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that
                largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield
                arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case,
                communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the
                algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe
                that up to 25{\%} of the communities are badly connected and up
                to 16{\%} are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce
                the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
                communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we
                prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it
                converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities
                are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast
                local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the
                Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden
                algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find
                that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm
