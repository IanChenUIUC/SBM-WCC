Only those ground-truth clusters with size greater than 10 was used. If a node had multiple memberships, it was assigned to the cluster with the smallest cluster id and stripped of its membership in all other clusters, thus making the ground-truth clustering disjoint. Each ground-truth cluster in the Youtube graph was assigned a noise score computed by the ratio of its external degree to total degree. For all sub figures, the x-axis marks the threshold such that only those ground-truth clusters with noise level less than the threshold is included. Consequently, clustering accuracies such as NMI, ARI, AGRI, RMI, and AMI are only computed on the reduced set of ground-truth clusters, ignoring any nodes not part of those clusters. Figure at the top left shows how many nodes remain in the set of ground-truth clusters following this thresholding step. Figure out the bottom left shows the distribution of cluster noise at different thresholds. The subfigures on the right show the clustering accuracies of all methods against each of the ground-truths thresholded at 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0. }

	\caption[]{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Wrong data. redo.}Empirical Statistics on Youtube Ground-truth Clusterings} We show the distributions over all the non-singleton clusters of conductance, modularity, normalized mincut size, density, and mixing parameter for the two different ways of creating a disjoint ground-truth partition for the ground-truth clusters of the Youtube graph. Density here is calculated by $\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}$ where $m$ is the number of edges inside the cluster and $n$ is the number of nodes inside the cluster. Mixing parameter here is computed by dividing the sum of external degree by sum of total degree over all nodes in a cluster. The ground-truth clusters, for both ways of processing the original ground-truth clustering, exhibit high conductance, low modularity, low normalized mincut sizes, low density, and high mixing parameters, indicating that the ground-truth clusters don't have good separability, are sparse, and have poor internal connectivity. High conductance and mixing parameter indicate low separability, low modularity and density indicate high sparsity, and low normalized mincut sizes indicate poor connectivity.}
